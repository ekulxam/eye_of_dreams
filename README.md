# The Eye of Dreams
The Eye of Dreams is a new item that can be worn on the player's head. During the night, the player will enter a _Slumbering_ state where they cannot interact with the world. However, they will gain increased movement capabilities, but hunger will be more quickly depleted. Entities that are not _Slumbering_ cannot see _Slumbering_ entities and vice versa (with the exception of Phantoms), but _Slumbering_ entities can see each other.

### Phantom Changes
To keep Dreamers in check, phantoms have undergone significant changes in this mod. They now grow and heal after attacking, can carry targets, have noClip, and move faster.
